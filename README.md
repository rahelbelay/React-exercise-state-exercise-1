The following exercises will give you more practice with creating classes and managing state.

. Create two function components: Input and OuputThe Input component should show a label (that says "type here") and a text input element
. The Output component should show an empty div
. Import these into your App component
## Change the App component to a class
. In App's constructor, add a state property with a single key: textValueGive textValue a value of "this is the text value in state"
Pass the textValue state property as a prop to the Input and also to the OutputIn your Input component, use the prop as the value of the text input element
. In your Output component, display the prop in the div
## Give App a helper function "_updateText" that receives a string as an argument and calls setState() to update the textValue in App's state
Pass "_updateText" as a second prop to the Input component
Use the prop as the onChange of the text input element
Make sure that as you type into the Input also appears in the Output
## Bonus feature #1: create a ClearInput component that contains a button. When the button is clicked, the text in the Input and the Output should be empty 
## Bonus feature #2: create an UpperCaseOputput component. Pass the textValue state property to it. It should display the same text, but in uppercase.
## Bonus feature #3: create a CaesarCipherOutput component.
